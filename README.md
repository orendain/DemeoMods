# DemeoMods

A collection of mods for Demeo.

## Mods

### SkipIntro

Skips the intro loading scene.

### RoomFinder

Tired of Demeo's "Quickjoin" endlessly placing you into random games? This mod
lists all public rooms, along with their properties, so you can find a game
you'd like and join it directly.

### Hmm ...

A handful of other mods are in use/development privately, but it is unknown if
any will be cleaned up enough to see the light of OSS.

- PlayerBerserk, allows players to become berserk/enraged.
- RoomCode, allows players to set their own room code instead of one being
  randomly generated.
- Highlighter, ...
- RuleSets, ...
- DungeonMasterView, ...

## Installation

> Note: Only PCVR versions of games are currently supported.
> E.g., playing on a Quest2 works, but only when linked to a PC.

1. Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader#how-to-use-the-installer).
2. Download the the mods that you would like to use from
   the [releases page](https://github.com/orendain/DemeoMods/releases).
3. Place the mod DLL files in the `/Mods` folder (created by MelonLoader) in
   your game directory.
4. Done. The mods will load automatically upon starting the game.

## For Developers

### `/Common`

A library of entities shared by more than one mod.

This is compiled as part of each dependent mod, so as to not generate a
common/util mod that needs to be included separately by each user.

Should there be any interest by other developers to reuse this library, the
author of this project can extract it into a common/util mod or
a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

Please file an issue if interested.

### `/Common/UI`

The start of a UI library, before the author decided too much time was being
spent on it :wink:. Now a set of helpers to make development of Unity views for
Demeo significantly easier.
