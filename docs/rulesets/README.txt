Want to create your own ruleset for HouseRules?

This folder includes copies of all built-in rulesets, so you can modify them to
your heart's content, or use them as a starting point for your own completely
custom ruleset.

An introduction to creating rulesets:
https://github.com/orendain/DemeoMods/wiki/Creating-Custom-Rulesets-for-HouseRules

A list of rules available to use, and how to configure them:
https://github.com/orendain/DemeoMods/tree/main/HouseRules.Essentials#rules-and-configurations

To have HouseRules load your custom ruleset, take the file and move it out of
this `ExampleRulesets` folder. Your custom ruleset file should be in the
`UserData\HouseRules` folder.

HouseRules will automatically load your ruleset when Demeo loads, and will
log messages to the console if it detects issues with your custom ruleset.

Good luck, and have fun!
