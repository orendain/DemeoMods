## Rulesets

### Built-in Rulesets

- __Earth Wind & Fire__ : Not the band. Let's get Elemental.
- __üï∑Ô∏èArachnophobiaüï∑Ô∏è__ : Offers a fresh adventure to be played on the RootsOfEvil Map.
  Chased by violent thugs from their ancestral homes in Sunderhaven, the King and Queen flee into the woods.
  Befriended by money spiders, they hatch a plan to rebuild their fallen empires, but first they're going to need some cash.
- __üé≤LuckyDipüé≤__ : Players each start with two 'Drop Chest' cards instead of their normal
  starting cards, meaning that no two games start the same. Many potions have AOE effect, because it's rude not to share.
  Many other changes included for faster gameplay with an aim of around 90 minutes per game.
- __üí£It's A Trapüí£__ : Build fiendiesh traps for your enemies and lure them to their deaths, but do try not to kill your friends. Lamps and BoobyTraps aplenty. Enemies cannot open doors, DetectEnemies/EyeOfAvalon & Torch will not be attacked, Stealth & TileEffect durations extended.
- __The Swirl__ : Only poison, fireballs and vortexes. Health and POIs aplenty, but must defeat all enemies to escape.
- __Beat The Clock__ : Ultra health. Ultra card recycling. Only 15 rounds to escape...
- __Hunter's Paradise__ : Pets, pets, pets! And hunter's mark.
- __Demeo Reloaded__ : The Gray Alien's ruleset. MANY class changes. NEW enemies. BETTER loot. No respawns. Yet somehow challenging...
- __Difficulty Easy__ : Decreased game difficulty for a more casual playstyle.
- __Difficulty Hard__ : Increased game difficulty for a greater challenge.
- __Difficulty Legendary__ : Increased game difficulty for those who want to be a legend.
- __3x3 Potions and Buffs__ : Heal, Strength, Speed, Adamant, Antitoxin, RepairArmor and Bard buffs are 3x3 AOE.
- __Better Sorcerer__ : 0 Action Cost for Sorcerer's Zap - No other changes. #STS
- __No Surprises__ :  No surprises in the dark or coming through doors.
- __Quick and the Dead__ : A mode with a small hand but fast turnaround time on cards means you need to not hesitate.
- __Flipping Out__ : Coin Flips ONLY! BIG ENEMIES! Heads... or tails?
### JSON Rulesets

Rulesets may also be configured as JSON files and stored within the game directory `<GAME_DIR>/UserData/HouseRules/<rulesetname>.json`

A copy of all built-in rulesets are included as JSON files and, after
HouseRules installation, can be found in the game directory
`<GAME_DIR>/UserData/HouseRules/ExampleRulesets/` so you can modify them
to your heart's content, or use them as a starting point for your own completely
custom ruleset.

Additionally, [those JSON rulesets can be found within this repository](../docs/rulesets).

The [Settings Reference](../docs/SettingsReference.md) contains lists of all different BehaviourIDs, AbilityKeys and other data types used by the Rules.

#### __RegainAbilityIfMaxxedOutOverridden__: Controls whether you get a potion back when you cast it on someone who is already at max.
  - This rule is to overcome a 'feature' that occurs if you apply an AOE range onto Strength/Speed potions. By default when you cast a strength or speed potion on someone who is already maxed out, you get it returned to your hand.

    - Specify the [AbilityKeys](../docs/SettingsReference.md#abilitykeys) of the ability to modify.
    - Specify `true` is using the ability while maxed out should return the ability card to the player, or `false` to prevent the card being returned to the player's hand.

  - To configure:
    - Specify the [BoardPieceId](../docs/SettingsReference.md#boardpieceids) of the piece to appear in each map.

    - Specify a list of status effects that should replace existing ones of the same type.

  ###### _Example JSON config for StatusEffectConfig_

  ```json
  {
    "Rule": "StatusEffectConfig",
    "Config": [

  - Overriding the durations allows for TileEffects to last for longer or shorter times.
  - It is necessary to specify all five effects in the config for this rule, or they will assume a default duration of 9999 rounds.
  - To configure:
    - Specify the `TileEfect` (Gas, Acidm etc) of the effect whose duration should be replaced.
    - Specify an integer representing the new duration in turns.

  ###### _Example JSON config for TileEffectDurationOverridden_

  ```json
  {
    "Rule": "TileEffectDurationOverridden",
