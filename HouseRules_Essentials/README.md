- __Difficulty Legendary__ : Increased game difficulty for those who want to be a legend.
- __No Surprises__ :  No surprises in the dark or coming through doors.
- __Quick and the Dead__ : A mode with a small hand but fast turnaround time on cards means you need to not hesitate.

### JSON Rulesets

Rulesets may also be configured as JSON files and stored within the game directory `<GAME_DIR>/UserData/HouseRules/<rulesetname>.json`

A selection are available within this repository. These are intended to be fun to play alternative games, and as a good examples for others wanting to create their own rulesets.

- __[üé≤LuckyDipüé≤ Ruleset](../docs/rulesets/LuckyDip.json)__ : Players each start with two 'Drop Chest' cards instead of their normal
starting cards, meaning that no two games start the same. Many potions have AOE effect, because it's rude not to share. 
Many other changes included for faster gameplay with an aim of around 90 minutes per game.
- __[üï∑Ô∏èArachnophobiaüï∑Ô∏è Ruleset](../docs/rulesets/Arachnophobia.json)__ offers a fresh adventure to be played on the RootsOfEvil Map.
Chased by violent thugs from their ancestral homes in Sunderhaven, the King and Queen flee into the woods. 
Befriended by money spiders, they hatch a plan to rebuild their fallen empires, but first they're going to need some cash.
